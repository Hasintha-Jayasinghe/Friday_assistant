First click on the install.bat file and download python verison 3.6.6 form the page it will open
After downloading the installer please run through the setup instructions and when I think in the last page please click the checkbox that says "add python to path"
After all this you can run the file by clicking on the path area of your file explorer and typing cmd and then when it opens typing python main.py will run the file
Thanks for donwloading friday
